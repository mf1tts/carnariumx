Trinket shivered a bit in the setting sun; she nestled a little closer to Red.  “I hate Septembers.” She told him.  

“Just because you never had autumn, doesn't mean the rest of us don't like it.” He replied.  

“I know.” They sat in silence for a while, listening to the sounds of traffic.  For those used to New York, the screech of brakes and honks of car horns are nothing out of the ordinary.  They fade into the background of daily life, much like the slight static below the music that plays on a radio.  For strangers, poets, and lovers, this static in the background becomes fine art, much as it did for Trinket and Red.  If Red's arm slid around Trinket's waist, or her head tilted onto his shoulder, neither commented on it.  

The portal began as a speck of light, no larger than a firefly.  It grew slowly, the area increasing a few square centimeters each second.  The greenish-gold light spread in a circle as it descended.  

Eventually, Trinket spoke.  “This is lovely and all, but next time, lets go someplace warmer.”

Red stiffened.  “Trinket, for me, I don't think there's going to be a next time.”

“You're staying?”

He nodded.  

Trinket scowled.  “You want to stay in New York, in the middle of the Vietnam War.  You're an idiot.”

“What?  I like it here.”

“There's a draft on, Red!”

“I spoke to Bluefish about this.  I know the numbers, and he fixed my birthday so I won't get called.” He explained.  

Trinket's jaw dropped.  “You've been planning this?  You knew you were going to stay, and you didn't bother to tell me?”

Red sighed.  “If you'd known I was staying, what would have changed?  You'd have been doubting and worrying this whole time.  As it is, you're going home with enough holo-footage of Terra to make a fortune.”

“We've been together four years.  Don't you think I deserve some kind of warning?”

“You knew this was coming.  Whether I stayed here, next stop, or eight jobs in the future, it didn't matter.  Look at me, Trinket.  Did I ever make you any promises?”

“No.” She muttered.  

“Did I ever ask anything of you?”

“Nothing I wasn't willing to give.”

“Then do this for me.  Go back without me, sell those clips, and find whatever the hell it is you're looking for.  I never told you, so I'm saying it now.  I do love you, Trinket Hayes, and that—that should scare the hell out of you.”

Trinket looked at him curiously.  “You're serious, aren't you?  You're serious!  You idiot!  Come on, I won't leave you!”

“I told you to go, okay?  I don't want what you want.  I'm sick of going after the next big job, sick of crappy bars, sick of watching you waste your life away just to prove you're as good as the guys!  And here, I can finally get what I need.  I like this city, I like this climate, and I like the fact that here, I don't have to be on the run.  Go through the damn portal, and tell Bluefish I'm not coming back!”

Trinket got up, turned around, slid through the portal.  

The portal trip was as bad as ever.  Three full seconds of acceleration later, she flew out in a graceless belly-flop into the deceleration pool.  She skidded ten feet, then rolled to float in the water.  

“He's not coming!” She called over the noise of the machinery to Bluefish, who was watching the portal curiously for signs of Red.  

“I know!” The technician replied, pressing a button on the panel.  The portal switched off, and the generators fell silent.  Bluefish sat at the edge of the pool.  “I should have warned you.”  

“It wasn't your place.” Trinket replied, studying her long-time acquaintance with new fascination.  Bluefish, contrary to his name, was neither blue nor especially piscine, but a thin man of indefinite heritage.  Trinket wondered briefly if he would be interested in a business partnership, but then reminded herself that he was married, with children.  She had never met his wife, but over the past few years, Bluefish had often found an excuse to drop the fact that he had a son into conversation.  

“Of course not.”  He smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling in amusement.  “It was Red's.  I always thought he was too good for you, but, given what he did...”

“He was too good for me?” Trinket laughed.  “He could never handle me.  That's why he stayed.  I was too much for him.”

“Right.”  Bluefish nodded, then got up.  “I have another arrival in ten minutes, so you should clear out by then.”
