Trinket ducked into the dirt-encrusted tavern, careful not to hit her head on the low doorframe.  Glancing across the room, she assessed the customers quickly.  The group of men along the wall by the gangsters was unlikely to welcome her, which left her with the diverse scattering of runners on her right.  

Before she could take a seat, a pair of Suits, universal mercenary guards, headed for her.  She began to unbutton her coat, aware she had some explaining to do.  

The tall Suit stopped in front of her and announced, “The boss wants to see you.”  

He offered her a scaly arm, but Trinket shook her head.  “I can escort myself, boys.”

“Look.” The other Suit interrupted.  “We got our orders, see.  The boss says he has to see all the strumpets as would camp in this den, and we follow his orders.”

“I’m nobody’s whore.” Trinket pulled open her coat, flashing the Suits a quick glance of the veritable arsenal she carried.  “I’m a businesswoman, and I’m here to make a deal.”

“Whoa there, darlin’!” The first Suit exclaimed.  “You sure you need all them guns here?”

“It’s a rough crowd.” She smiled, and knelt to unfasten a boot knife.  “This here Marfan steel ought to do a token of authenticity, right, boys?”

“Sure thing.” The Suit replied.  

Trinket nodded as they walked off.  By the time they found out that the dagger was a counterfeit, she’d be long gone.  She strolled over and plopped down next to one of the runners.  

Her boothmate was lean and wiry, with a twitch in his eye that meant she’d have to watch her step.  His scarred hands caressed the neck of his liquor bottle, and he bore a set of horizontal scars on the back of his hand.  He reeked of alcohol and dirty money, but his eyes glimmered with the wisdom of a veteran runner.  

“So,” Trinket asked him, “Who’s running what in this place?”

The old man took a moment to acknowledge her.  “A girl like you should be out finding a proper life, not seeking runners in bars.” He said gravely. “It’s a life of borrowing problems and raising hell.  It’s not romantic, so pack up your starry-eyed notions and go home.”

“Trust me.” She laughed.  “I’ve raised plenty of hell already.”

“Sure.” The runner said.  “What are you carrying?”

It was a traditional phrase among timerunners, and Trinket gave the only acceptable reply.  “Trouble.”  

He nodded in recognition.  “Marlin Xavier, veteran, Old Burgundy.  You?”

“Trinket Hayes bearing Crimson Rising.” She swallowed briefly.  The Xavier patriarch was more dangerous than she cared for.  

“Crimson, huh?  That’s one of the newer ports, isn’t it?”

“Aye.” She grinned, glad he wasn't bringing up politics.  “The Feds had it for a while, but they could never keep it.  Runners are born free, and there’s not a Fed born that could chain one.”

“I like you.” Marlin’s face wrinkled into the semblance of a smile, before he took a gulp of his liquor.  Based on the smell of his breath, Trinket guessed that the bottle contained enough alcohol that, properly diluted, could intoxicate a whole monastery for a month.  “What are you looking for?”

“A partner.” Trinket replied.  “I’m looking to hire out, go freelance, but I need some connections.  The fellow I was working with on the way here, he took Runner’s Choice.”

Marlin sighed at the euphemism.  “He stayed, you mean.  Not a lot of us put up with this life.  The ports get in your blood, Trinket, and there’s no choice but to keep moving.  Don’t be stuck too long, or you’ll get rooted, don’t move too much, or you’ll end up a veteran who drinks the remainder their life away gossiping in port bars.  Now, who you looking for?”

“I told you.” Trinket replied.  “Someone with connections.  Man or woman, I don’t care.  Mobile, bright, hopefully not a fellow Crimson.  We’re stubborn folk, and I’ll not be butting heads with them.”

“There’s just the fellow in here.” Marlin told her.  “Balm Grisson from Terra V.  He’s my nephew, and you won’t meet a sharper fellow.  Amiable, freelance, looking for someone with muscle.  You seem to fit the qualifications.  He’s over playing poker with the gangsters.  Tell him Xavier sent you.”



Balm Grisson was a young timerunner, perhaps three years older than Trinket, built along the same lines as his uncle.  From the easy way he tossed the playing cards, she quickly assessed his potential.  The cheery smile in the corner of his mouth boded fine, though he’d never make a true con, since that was such a tell.  The grace with which he dealt the cards gave a deadly air to his dark, lean frame.  Sharp, spirited eyes illuminated a refined face, similar, Trinket suspected, to his uncle's before the years and the drink took Marlin’s youth.  Yes, he would do.  

Approaching him took little effort.  As one gangster raked in his winnings, Trinket strode over and tossed a few credits on the table.  “Deal me in.” She said, taking a seat.  

“The ante’s ten credits.” Balm told her, when the gangster who had just won shrugged with ambivalent acceptance.  “Cash only, Standard Galaxy-current tender.”

“Fine by me.” She picked up her single credits, and lay down a ten-credit piece.  “Which rules we using?”

“Five-card draw, aces wild.” The gangster hissed.  

Upon receiving her hand, Trinket let a shadow of disappointment flicker across her face, only to replace it with a self-assured smile and a twitch of her right eye.  Pair eights, king high.  It wasn’t an excellent hand, but she could work with it.  She didn’t even glance at the gangsters.  She hadn’t spent much time on their planet, and even so, she never tried to read strangers for a tell.  It took too much attention from the game.  

The gangsters bid freely, and Trinket followed their lead.  When it came time to discard, she handed Balm two cards and got a king and an ace.  Two pair.  That would do.  

She bid all out, tossing credit after credit into the center of the table.  One by one, the other gangsters dropped out, leaving the game between her, Balm, and the previous winner.  Soon, she tossed a hundred credits on the table.  “Call.” She told him.  

The gangster flipped over his cards.  “Pair fives, Jack high.” He hissed.  

Trinket lay down her hand.  “Two pair, Kings over eights.”  She glanced at Balm.  “What are you carrying?”

His face flickered with acknowledgement, but he didn’t miss a beat.  “Trouble.” He said.  “For both of you.  Flush.”

“Nice.” Trinket grinned.  “Trinket Hayes of Crimson Rising.  You?”

“Balm Grisson, Old Burgundy.  What are you looking for?”

“A partner.” She replied.  “My last one took Runner’s Choice, so I’m looking for someone to freelance with.  I met your uncle.  He said to say Xavier sent me.”

Balm got up, giving the others a universal ‘a moment please’ gesture.  Trinket understood, and followed him.  “Xavier?”

“That’s what he told me.”

Balm smiled, and waved at the gangsters to continue play.  He offered her a seat.  Trinket sat down and leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table.  “So,” Balm’s grin was positively wicked.  “Do you have a job, or is there a sponsor?”

Trinket smiled back.  “Neither.  My partner took Runner’s Choice, so I’m stuck on this side of the void, with no way back to the Trail.  I need a native to help me get jobs.”

“Damn.  A client I could turn down, but Uncle Marlin knows people.  You’re looking for a partner, aren’t you?”

“Yep.”

“And you’re a sharpshooter?”

“Explosives Expert.”

“Close enough.  Honest?”

“Would you trust a runner who answered that?”

“I’d say you’re hired, accept, y’know…”

“Equals.”  Trinket grinned.  “What's selling big on this piece of rock?”

“Absolutely nothing.” He sighed.  “I got here a few months ago, and all that's happened is my uncle taking territory from Bloodeye.”

“Well, there's been call for relics out on Custer, if you're into rooting around on Old Terra.”
