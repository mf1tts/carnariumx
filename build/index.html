          <p>At the knock on the door, Niamh looks up from her script.</p>
<p>“One moment!” she calls.</p>
<p>Still cozy and half-asleep, her partner, Yates, groans in protest at the noise.</p>
<p>She walks over to sit on the edge of the bed. She speaks softly, on hand on their shoulder. “It’s a hour past dawn, just like I requested, dear. Time to put your face on and start the day.’</p>
<p>They look up for a moment and glare—a look that would be unsettling, were she not used to the changeling’s blank, unshifted features. Yates is the first to break eye contact, as they grunt and pull the covers over their head. </p>
<p>Niamh kisses their head through the blankets and goes to answer the door.  She exchanges a few words, takes their dried cloaks from the tavern servant and gives her a few coppers as a tip before returning to the side of the bed.</p>
<p>“The servant just told me something you might find interesting.” She leans over, whispering at what is (hopefully) Yeats’ far ear.</p>
<p>“Mmerwah?” They mumble into the bedding in response.</p>
<p>“The kitchen’s running low on eggs, and nobody wants to gather more until it stops raining.” She says. “and I know you hate porridge, so…”</p>
<p>She sits up as she feels Yeats begin to shift under her. He pulls the covers back and sits up, his usual mask firmly in place.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
          <p>Trinket downed another shot as she listened to Bloodeye.  “It&#39;s an excellent opportunity, there.  All I need is for you to run some Chinese opium, and all give you two hundred credits a milligram.” He was saying.  “Look, my last boy up and quit, so I really need this.  If I don&#39;t get some soon, my girls will start going into withdrawal.  I&#39;m desperate.  What do you say?”</p>
<p>She looked at the aging procurer, wondering briefly if his single eye was actually damaged by the acid the had eaten away his other one, or if it was simply bloodshot from too many drugs.  “I still don&#39;t handle drugs.” She told him.  “I don&#39;t mind running adylose or coxibs, but I will not go near your opiates.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” Bloodeye coaxed.  “One run, and you&#39;ll be rich.  Morals—” He pointed sharply at her, “Are for those who can afford them.”</p>
<p>“And I can.” Trinket tossed back a caplet of adylose.  “Red took Choice, and I hit it rich.  Forty thou, and that&#39;s just on the still-frame holos for museums.  I&#39;ve still got films for private collectors.”</p>
<p>“Then do it as a favor.  I&#39;ve been good to you, haven&#39;t I?  Who drops hints at you that museums want holos, anyways? Me.  Who loans you credits when you go broke? Me.  Who shelled you up for a month last year? Me.  Please?”</p>
<p>“Look.” The bartender set a fuschia drink in front of Bloodeye.  “You&#39;re here to drink, that&#39;s good.  But the lady isn&#39;t interested.  You don&#39;t quit giving her trouble, things are going to get ugly.”</p>
<p>Trinket gave the bartender a grateful nod.  “Like he said.  No.  Still not running drugs.”</p>
<p>“You&#39;ll live to regret it.”  Bloodeye warned as he got up to leave, “Your life would be a hell of a lot easier if you just got over your stupid morals.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Trinket smiled.  </p>
<p>The door slammed shut as a handful of runners entered.  “Bullshit!” one of then yelled.  “There&#39;s no way you did her!”</p>
<p>“Sure I did!” Another replied.  “Not very good though.  Union women moralize too much.  Don&#39;t bother with that.”</p>
<p>“hey, lookee! That a chit of Bloodeye&#39;s?” a third asked.  </p>
<p>“She&#39;s a looker!”the first commented.  </p>
<p>“Don&#39;t think so.” The fourth replied.  “Too sturdy.  Bloodeye&#39;s girls are more breakable.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he&#39;s catering to a new audience.” The first replied.  “She&#39;s got the tracks.”</p>
<p>“His girls do opium, not heroin.” Four told him.  </p>
<p>“What&#39;s the difference in opiates mean to him?” Three asked.  </p>
<p>Trinket spoke up.  “Everything.  He just asked me, specifically, for opium from China, back on Terra.”</p>
<p>“See,” Four said.  “She&#39;s no whore.  She&#39;s a runner.”</p>
<p>“Slim difference.” Two said.  </p>
<p>“Difference enough.” Trinket tossed a few credits on the counter.  “I work just as hard as you do, so don&#39;t act like I&#39;m one of Bloodeye&#39;s whores.”</p>
<p>“So,” Two asked, “Do you do all your partners, or just the ones who give you a generous cut?”</p>
<p>“I doubt she does at all.” Three replied.  “She&#39;s not the type.  If I wanted an ox in my bed, I wouldn&#39;t run to a girl who&#39;d charge me.”</p>
<p>Trinket laughed.  “If I were an ox, I suppose I&#39;d be real flattered.  I bet you&#39;re a hit with all the ladies.”</p>
<p>“That&#39;s Pane.” The first runner jerked his thumb at Two.  </p>
<p>“Right.  And you are?”</p>
<p>“Skullface.”  he replied.  </p>
<p>“Fox.” Three introduced himself.  </p>
<p>“Nine.” Four showed her his hands to illustrate his missing left thumb.  </p>
<p>“Helluva finger to lose.”  Trinket told him.  She called to the bartender.  “The next round&#39;s on me!”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma&#39;am.” The bartender nodded.  </p>
<p>“Which one of us do you have your eye on?” Fox asked.  “&#39;cause I&#39;ll save you the trouble and turn you down now.”</p>
<p>“None of you.  What I need is news.  What&#39;s happened the past three months?”</p>
<p>“Months?” Pane laughed.  “You must have one helluva set of connections to get a three-month return on Burgundy.”</p>
<p>“My partner did.”  Trinket said.  “I don&#39;t.”</p>
<p>“Well, things haven&#39;t exactly been quiet around here.  No raids, but Xavier came in from off-planet.  He got into a spat with Bloodeye about something, and they&#39;ve been at it for the last six weeks.” Nine explained. “Bloodeye beat up Xavier&#39;s pretty-boy, and the old man&#39;s been weaving his way into the city since then.  This past couple weeks, he&#39;s been tightening the stranglehold, and Bloodeye&#39;s feeling the pinch.”</p>
<p>“That&#39;s a lot to digest.  So how&#39;s Bloodeye coping?” Trinket slid a few credits toward the man, but he waved them off.  </p>
<p>“I&#39;ll call you on it later.” Nine said, referring to the coins.  “Mostly, he&#39;s been struggling to stay afloat.  The city&#39;s pretty much divided, and with his resources cut off, it&#39;s just a matter of time before he gives the old man whatever he&#39;s looking for.”</p>
<p>“That&#39;s the problem with drugging your whores.” Trinket observed, signaling the batender for another drink.  “I keeps them compliant as long as you&#39;ve got some, but businesses on withdrawal can be such a bitch.”</p>
<p>“Basically,” Skullface told her, “Bloodeye has the whorehouses, so Xavier&#39;s districts--”</p>
<p>“I don&#39;t do that.” Trinket said.  “Even if I did, I doubt my clients would appreciate it much.  I&#39;m a little too thorny for most tastes.”</p>
<p>“I noticed.” Fox commented.  </p>

        <h2 class="p-name">Trinket Gets Dumped</h2>

          <p>Trinket shivered a bit in the setting sun; she nestled a little closer to Red.  “I hate Septembers.” She told him.  </p>
<p>“Just because you never had autumn, doesn&#39;t mean the rest of us don&#39;t like it.” He replied.  </p>
<p>“I know.” They sat in silence for a while, listening to the sounds of traffic.  For those used to New York, the screech of brakes and honks of car horns are nothing out of the ordinary.  They fade into the background of daily life, much like the slight static below the music that plays on a radio.  For strangers, poets, and lovers, this static in the background becomes fine art, much as it did for Trinket and Red.  If Red&#39;s arm slid around Trinket&#39;s waist, or her head tilted onto his shoulder, neither commented on it.  </p>
<p>The portal began as a speck of light, no larger than a firefly.  It grew slowly, the area increasing a few square centimeters each second.  The greenish-gold light spread in a circle as it descended.  </p>
<p>Eventually, Trinket spoke.  “This is lovely and all, but next time, lets go someplace warmer.”</p>
<p>Red stiffened.  “Trinket, for me, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be a next time.”</p>
<p>“You&#39;re staying?”</p>
<p>He nodded.  </p>
<p>Trinket scowled.  “You want to stay in New York, in the middle of the Vietnam War.  You&#39;re an idiot.”</p>
<p>“What?  I like it here.”</p>
<p>“There&#39;s a draft on, Red!”</p>
<p>“I spoke to Bluefish about this.  I know the numbers, and he fixed my birthday so I won&#39;t get called.” He explained.  </p>
<p>Trinket&#39;s jaw dropped.  “You&#39;ve been planning this?  You knew you were going to stay, and you didn&#39;t bother to tell me?”</p>
<p>Red sighed.  “If you&#39;d known I was staying, what would have changed?  You&#39;d have been doubting and worrying this whole time.  As it is, you&#39;re going home with enough holo-footage of Terra to make a fortune.”</p>
<p>“We&#39;ve been together four years.  Don&#39;t you think I deserve some kind of warning?”</p>
<p>“You knew this was coming.  Whether I stayed here, next stop, or eight jobs in the future, it didn&#39;t matter.  Look at me, Trinket.  Did I ever make you any promises?”</p>
<p>“No.” She muttered.  </p>
<p>“Did I ever ask anything of you?”</p>
<p>“Nothing I wasn&#39;t willing to give.”</p>
<p>“Then do this for me.  Go back without me, sell those clips, and find whatever the hell it is you&#39;re looking for.  I never told you, so I&#39;m saying it now.  I do love you, Trinket Hayes, and that—that should scare the hell out of you.”</p>
<p>Trinket looked at him curiously.  “You&#39;re serious, aren&#39;t you?  You&#39;re serious!  You idiot!  Come on, I won&#39;t leave you!”</p>
<p>“I told you to go, okay?  I don&#39;t want what you want.  I&#39;m sick of going after the next big job, sick of crappy bars, sick of watching you waste your life away just to prove you&#39;re as good as the guys!  And here, I can finally get what I need.  I like this city, I like this climate, and I like the fact that here, I don&#39;t have to be on the run.  Go through the damn portal, and tell Bluefish I&#39;m not coming back!”</p>
<p>Trinket got up, turned around, slid through the portal.  </p>
<p>The portal trip was as bad as ever.  Three full seconds of acceleration later, she flew out in a graceless belly-flop into the deceleration pool.  She skidded ten feet, then rolled to float in the water.  </p>
<p>“He&#39;s not coming!” She called over the noise of the machinery to Bluefish, who was watching the portal curiously for signs of Red.  </p>
<p>“I know!” The technician replied, pressing a button on the panel.  The portal switched off, and the generators fell silent.  Bluefish sat at the edge of the pool.  “I should have warned you.”  </p>
<p>“It wasn&#39;t your place.” Trinket replied, studying her long-time acquaintance with new fascination.  Bluefish, contrary to his name, was neither blue nor especially piscine, but a thin man of indefinite heritage.  Trinket wondered briefly if he would be interested in a business partnership, but then reminded herself that he was married, with children.  She had never met his wife, but over the past few years, Bluefish had often found an excuse to drop the fact that he had a son into conversation.  </p>
<p>“Of course not.”  He smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling in amusement.  “It was Red&#39;s.  I always thought he was too good for you, but, given what he did...”</p>
<p>“He was too good for me?” Trinket laughed.  “He could never handle me.  That&#39;s why he stayed.  I was too much for him.”</p>
<p>“Right.”  Bluefish nodded, then got up.  “I have another arrival in ten minutes, so you should clear out by then.”</p>
