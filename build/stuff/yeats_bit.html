    <h1>The Last Morning</h1>

    <p>At the knock on the door, Niamh looks up from her script.</p>
<p>“One moment!” she calls.</p>
<p>Still cozy and half-asleep, her partner, Yates, groans in protest at the noise.</p>
<p>She walks over to sit on the edge of the bed. She speaks softly, on hand on their shoulder. “It’s a hour past dawn, just like I requested, dear. Time to put your face on and start the day.’</p>
<p>They look up for a moment and glare—a look that would be unsettling, were she not used to the changeling’s blank, unshifted features. Yates is the first to break eye contact, as they grunt and pull the covers over their head. </p>
<p>Niamh kisses their head through the blankets and goes to answer the door.  She exchanges a few words, takes their dried cloaks from the tavern servant and gives her a few coppers as a tip before returning to the side of the bed.</p>
<p>“The servant just told me something you might find interesting.” She leans over, whispering at what is (hopefully) Yeats’ far ear.</p>
<p>“Mmerwah?” They mumble into the bedding in response.</p>
<p>“The kitchen’s running low on eggs, and nobody wants to gather more until it stops raining.” She says. “and I know you hate porridge, so…”</p>
<p>She sits up as she feels Yeats begin to shift under her. He pulls the covers back and sits up, his usual mask firmly in place.</p>
