    <h1>Trinket, Human Mess</h1>

    <p>Trinket downed another shot as she listened to Bloodeye.  “It&#39;s an excellent opportunity, there.  All I need is for you to run some Chinese opium, and all give you two hundred credits a milligram.” He was saying.  “Look, my last boy up and quit, so I really need this.  If I don&#39;t get some soon, my girls will start going into withdrawal.  I&#39;m desperate.  What do you say?”</p>
<p>She looked at the aging procurer, wondering briefly if his single eye was actually damaged by the acid the had eaten away his other one, or if it was simply bloodshot from too many drugs.  “I still don&#39;t handle drugs.” She told him.  “I don&#39;t mind running adylose or coxibs, but I will not go near your opiates.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” Bloodeye coaxed.  “One run, and you&#39;ll be rich.  Morals—” He pointed sharply at her, “Are for those who can afford them.”</p>
<p>“And I can.” Trinket tossed back a caplet of adylose.  “Red took Choice, and I hit it rich.  Forty thou, and that&#39;s just on the still-frame holos for museums.  I&#39;ve still got films for private collectors.”</p>
<p>“Then do it as a favor.  I&#39;ve been good to you, haven&#39;t I?  Who drops hints at you that museums want holos, anyways? Me.  Who loans you credits when you go broke? Me.  Who shelled you up for a month last year? Me.  Please?”</p>
<p>“Look.” The bartender set a fuschia drink in front of Bloodeye.  “You&#39;re here to drink, that&#39;s good.  But the lady isn&#39;t interested.  You don&#39;t quit giving her trouble, things are going to get ugly.”</p>
<p>Trinket gave the bartender a grateful nod.  “Like he said.  No.  Still not running drugs.”</p>
<p>“You&#39;ll live to regret it.”  Bloodeye warned as he got up to leave, “Your life would be a hell of a lot easier if you just got over your stupid morals.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Trinket smiled.  </p>
<p>The door slammed shut as a handful of runners entered.  “Bullshit!” one of then yelled.  “There&#39;s no way you did her!”</p>
<p>“Sure I did!” Another replied.  “Not very good though.  Union women moralize too much.  Don&#39;t bother with that.”</p>
<p>“hey, lookee! That a chit of Bloodeye&#39;s?” a third asked.  </p>
<p>“She&#39;s a looker!”the first commented.  </p>
<p>“Don&#39;t think so.” The fourth replied.  “Too sturdy.  Bloodeye&#39;s girls are more breakable.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he&#39;s catering to a new audience.” The first replied.  “She&#39;s got the tracks.”</p>
<p>“His girls do opium, not heroin.” Four told him.  </p>
<p>“What&#39;s the difference in opiates mean to him?” Three asked.  </p>
<p>Trinket spoke up.  “Everything.  He just asked me, specifically, for opium from China, back on Terra.”</p>
<p>“See,” Four said.  “She&#39;s no whore.  She&#39;s a runner.”</p>
<p>“Slim difference.” Two said.  </p>
<p>“Difference enough.” Trinket tossed a few credits on the counter.  “I work just as hard as you do, so don&#39;t act like I&#39;m one of Bloodeye&#39;s whores.”</p>
<p>“So,” Two asked, “Do you do all your partners, or just the ones who give you a generous cut?”</p>
<p>“I doubt she does at all.” Three replied.  “She&#39;s not the type.  If I wanted an ox in my bed, I wouldn&#39;t run to a girl who&#39;d charge me.”</p>
<p>Trinket laughed.  “If I were an ox, I suppose I&#39;d be real flattered.  I bet you&#39;re a hit with all the ladies.”</p>
<p>“That&#39;s Pane.” The first runner jerked his thumb at Two.  </p>
<p>“Right.  And you are?”</p>
<p>“Skullface.”  he replied.  </p>
<p>“Fox.” Three introduced himself.  </p>
<p>“Nine.” Four showed her his hands to illustrate his missing left thumb.  </p>
<p>“Helluva finger to lose.”  Trinket told him.  She called to the bartender.  “The next round&#39;s on me!”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma&#39;am.” The bartender nodded.  </p>
<p>“Which one of us do you have your eye on?” Fox asked.  “&#39;cause I&#39;ll save you the trouble and turn you down now.”</p>
<p>“None of you.  What I need is news.  What&#39;s happened the past three months?”</p>
<p>“Months?” Pane laughed.  “You must have one helluva set of connections to get a three-month return on Burgundy.”</p>
<p>“My partner did.”  Trinket said.  “I don&#39;t.”</p>
<p>“Well, things haven&#39;t exactly been quiet around here.  No raids, but Xavier came in from off-planet.  He got into a spat with Bloodeye about something, and they&#39;ve been at it for the last six weeks.” Nine explained. “Bloodeye beat up Xavier&#39;s pretty-boy, and the old man&#39;s been weaving his way into the city since then.  This past couple weeks, he&#39;s been tightening the stranglehold, and Bloodeye&#39;s feeling the pinch.”</p>
<p>“That&#39;s a lot to digest.  So how&#39;s Bloodeye coping?” Trinket slid a few credits toward the man, but he waved them off.  </p>
<p>“I&#39;ll call you on it later.” Nine said, referring to the coins.  “Mostly, he&#39;s been struggling to stay afloat.  The city&#39;s pretty much divided, and with his resources cut off, it&#39;s just a matter of time before he gives the old man whatever he&#39;s looking for.”</p>
<p>“That&#39;s the problem with drugging your whores.” Trinket observed, signaling the batender for another drink.  “I keeps them compliant as long as you&#39;ve got some, but businesses on withdrawal can be such a bitch.”</p>
<p>“Basically,” Skullface told her, “Bloodeye has the whorehouses, so Xavier&#39;s districts--”</p>
<p>“I don&#39;t do that.” Trinket said.  “Even if I did, I doubt my clients would appreciate it much.  I&#39;m a little too thorny for most tastes.”</p>
<p>“I noticed.” Fox commented.  </p>
